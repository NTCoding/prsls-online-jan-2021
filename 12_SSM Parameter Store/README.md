# Module 12: SSM Parameter Store

## Environment variables is not the answer for every configuration

So far all the configurations for our functions have been passed along via environment variables.

While environment variables is easy to configure and access from our code, and the Serverless framework makes it possible to share environment variables across all the functions in a project.

They do have a number of limitations:

* **Hard to share across projects**. For example, services might want to publicize their URLs, and API constraints (e.g. max batch size for updates, etc., like the ones you see in the AWS Service Quota console) so that other services can discover them easily without each having to hardcode in their own environment variables.

* **Cannot update an environment variable without deployment**. This is especially painful for those shared configs, which requires all dependent services to go through its own deployment.

* **Not a safe place for secrets, API keys, etc**. It's the first place an attacker would look if they ever compromise your function (maybe through a malicious/compromised dependency). There has been numerous attacks against NPM ecosystem that steals env variables.

My rule of thumb wrt environment variable is to use them for *static configuration* and *references to intra-service resources*. That is, resources that is part of this service.

**References to intra-service resources**
For example, DynamoDB tables that are owned and only used by this service. If they were to change, you will have to do an deployment anyway, and doing so will update the environment variables too. We have a lot of examples of this in our demo app - DynamoDB table names, Cognito user pool ID, etc.

**Static configurations**
For example, the default max no. of restaurants to show in the homepage, etc. You know, the kinda thing that you'll consider hardcoding into your app.

## Configurations that are not suitable for environment variables

**Dynamic configurations**
This includes any app configurations that you may wish to change on the fly, or allow a product/business owner to tweak and experiment with.

Depending on your requirements here, you can use SSM Parameter Store or external tools such as [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com) or [Split](https://www.split.io).

For configurations that you want to change on the fly without having to redeploy the service(s), you should use SSM Parameter Store.

If you want to do A/B testing on different configurations, or implement a canary deployment for rolling out config changes, then consider using an external service such as LaunchDarkly or Split.

ps. there are some tricks to make Lambda work with LaunchDarkly, you can read more about them [here](https://lumigo.io/blog/canary-deployment-with-launchdarkly-and-aws-lambda/).

**Secrets**
For application secrets, you absolutely do not want to store them in environment variables in plain text.

Instead, you should load them from either SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager during a cold start, decrypt, and save the decrypted secrets in the application `context`. Again, **DON'T** put the decrypted secrets into the environment variable.

You should also cache them and invalidate the cache every X minutes so to allow rotation of these secrets where applicable.

In the following exercises, we're going to see how this can be done.

If you want to learn the difference between SSM Parameter Store and Secrets Manager, then check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I_ZrgjAdQw).

## Load dynamic configurations and app secrets

**Goal:** Load app configurations from SSM Parameter Store with cache and cache invalidation

In the `get-restaurants` and `search-restaurants` functions, we have hardcoded a default no. of restaurants to return.

```javascript
const defaultResults = process.env.defaultResults || 8
```

This is a reasonable example of something that you might wanna tweak on the fly.

Fortunately, for Node.js functions there is the [middy](https://github.com/middyjs) middleware engine. It comes with a [SSM middleware](https://github.com/middyjs/middy/blob/master/docs/middlewares.md#ssm) that can implement the flow for us:

* load app configure at cold start
* cache it
* invalidate the cache at a specified frequency

<details>
<summary><b>Add configurations to SSM Parameter Store</b></summary><p>

1. Go to `Systems Manager` console in AWS

2. Go to `Parameter Store`

3. Click `Create Parameter`

4. Use the name `/{service-name}/dev/get-restaurants/config` where `service-name` is the `service` name in your `serverless.yml`.

For the value of the parameter, to allow us to add other configurations in the future, let's enter a JSON string:

```json
{
  "defaultResults": 8
}
```

![](/images/mod12-001.png)

5. Click `Create Parameter`

6. Repeat step 3-5 to create another `/{service-name}/dev/search-restaurant/config` parameter, also set it to

```json
{
  "defaultResults": 8
}
```

</p></details>

<details>
<summary><b>Load SSM parameters at runtime</b></summary><p>

1. First install `middy` as a dependency.

`npm install --save @middy/core`

and also Middy's SSM middleware:

`npm install --save @middy/ssm`

2. To load the parameters we created in the last step, we need to know the `service` and `stage` names at runtime.

These are perfect examples of static values that can be passed in via environment variables. So let's do that.

Open `serverless.yml`, under `provider`, let's add two environment variables for `serviceName` and `stage`. **NOTE**: environment variables that are configured under `provider.environment` would be copied to all functions by defautl.

This is what we need to add:

```yml
environment:
  serviceName: ${self:service}
  stage: ${self:provider.stage}
```

After this change, your `provider` section should look like this:

```yml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs12.x
  environment:
    serviceName: ${self:service}
    stage: ${self:provider.stage}
```

3. Open `functions/get-restaurants.js`, and add these two lines to the top to require `middy` and its `ssm` middleware.

```javascript
const middy = require('@middy/core')
const ssm = require('@middy/ssm')
```

4. On ln6

```javascript
const defaultResults = process.env.defaultResults || 8
```

We no longer need this, as `defaultResults` would come from the configuration we have in SSM.

But, we need to know the `service` name and `stage` name so we can fetch the parameter we created earlier.

So, replace this line with the following.

```javascript
const { serviceName, stage } = process.env
```

5. Replace the whole `module.exports.handler = ...` block with the following:

```javascript
module.exports.handler = middy(async (event, context) => {
  const restaurants = await getRestaurants(process.env.defaultResults)
  const response = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(restaurants)
  }

  return response
}).use(ssm({
  cache: true,
  cacheExpiryInMillis: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 mins
  names: {
    config: `/${serviceName}/${stage}/get-restaurants/config`
  },
  onChange: () => {
    const config = JSON.parse(process.env.config)
    process.env.defaultResults = config.defaultResults
  }  
}))
```

Let's take a moment to talk through what we've just done.

[Middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy) is a middleware engine that let's you run middlewares (basically, bits of logic before and after your handler code runs). To use it you have to wrap the handler code, i.e.

```javascript
middy(async (event, context) => {
  ... // function handler logic goes here
})
```

This returns a wrapped function, which exposes a `.use` method, that lets you chain middlewares that you want to apply. You can read about how it works [here](https://github.com/middyjs/middy#how-it-works).

So, to add the `ssm` middleware, we have:

```javascript
middy(async (event, context) => {
  ... // function handler logic goes here
}).use(ssm({
  ... // configuration of the SSM middleware goes here
}))
```

* `cache: true` tells the middleware to cache the SSM parameter value, so we don't hammer SSM Parameter Store with requests.
* `cacheExpiryInMillis: 5 * 60 * 1000` allows the cached value to be expired after 5 minutes. So if we change the configuration in SSM Parameter Store, then the concurrent executions would load the new value when their cache expires, without needing a deployment.
* `names: { config: ... }` fetches individual parameters and stores them in either the invocation `context` object, or the environment variables. By default, they're stored in the environment variables, but we can use another optional config `setToContext` to tell the middleware to store them in the `context` object instead.
* `onChange: () => { ... }` is necessary here because the parameter string is a JSON, so we need to parse it, and store it somewhere. So in this case, we only care about `defaultResults`, so we put that in an environment variable.

```javascript
const config = JSON.parse(process.env.config)
process.env.defaultResults = config.defaultResults
```

* notice on ln22, where we call the `getRestaurants` function? Now, we're passing `process.env.defaultResults` that we set above.

```javascript
const restaurants = await getRestaurants(process.env.defaultResults)
```

6. Let's run our integration tests to make sure everything still works.

`npm run test`

```
 PASS  tests/test_cases/get-index.tests.js
 PASS  tests/test_cases/get-restaurants.tests.js
 PASS  tests/test_cases/search-restaurants.tests.js

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        5.082 s, estimated 9 s
Ran all test suites.
```

That's great! Now, let's do the same thing for the `search-restaurants` function.

7. Open `functions/search-restaurants.js`, and add these two lines to the top.

```javascript
const middy = require('@middy/core')
const ssm = require('@middy/ssm')
```

8. Replace ln6

```javascript
const defaultResults = process.env.defaultResults || 8
```

with the following

```javascript
const { serviceName, stage } = process.env
```

9. Replace the whole `module.exports.handler = ...` block with the following.

```javascript
module.exports.handler = middy(async (event, context) => {
  const req = JSON.parse(event.body)
  const theme = req.theme
  const restaurants = await findRestaurantsByTheme(theme, process.env.defaultResults)
  const response = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(restaurants)
  }

  return response
}).use(ssm({
  cache: true,
  cacheExpiryInMillis: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 mins
  names: {
    config: `/${serviceName}/${stage}/search-restaurants/config`
  },
  onChange: () => {
    const config = JSON.parse(process.env.config)
    process.env.defaultResults = config.defaultResults
  }
}))
```

This is essentially the same change we made in the `get-restaurants` function, except, pointing to a different SSM parameter.

10. Rerun the integration tests.

`npm run test`

and see that all three tests are still passing.

```
 PASS  tests/test_cases/get-index.tests.js
 PASS  tests/test_cases/get-restaurants.tests.js
 PASS  tests/test_cases/search-restaurants.tests.js

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        4.897s, estimated 9s
```

</p></details>

<details>
<summary><b>Configure IAM permissions</b></summary><p>

There's one last thing we need to do for this to work once we deploy the app - IAM permissions.

1. Open `serverless.yml`, and find the `iamRoleStatements` block under `provider`, add the following permission statement.

```yml
- Effect: Allow
  Action: ssm:GetParameters*
  Resource:
    - arn:aws:ssm:#{AWS::Region}:#{AWS::AccountId}:parameter/${self:service}/${self:provider.stage}/get-restaurants/config
    - arn:aws:ssm:#{AWS::Region}:#{AWS::AccountId}:parameter/${self:service}/${self:provider.stage}/search-restaurants/config
```

After the change, the `iamRoleStatements` block should look like this.

```yml
iamRoleStatements:
  - Effect: Allow
    Action: dynamodb:scan
    Resource: !GetAtt RestaurantsTable.Arn
  - Effect: Allow
    Action: execute-api:Invoke
    Resource: arn:aws:execute-api:#{AWS::Region}:#{AWS::AccountId}:#{ApiGatewayRestApi}/${self:provider.stage}/GET/restaurants
  - Effect: Allow
    Action: ssm:GetParameters*
    Resource:
      - arn:aws:ssm:#{AWS::Region}:#{AWS::AccountId}:parameter/${self:service}/${self:provider.stage}/get-restaurants/config
      - arn:aws:ssm:#{AWS::Region}:#{AWS::AccountId}:parameter/${self:service}/${self:provider.stage}/search-restaurants/config
```

2. Deploy the project

`npx sls deploy`

3. Run the acceptance to make sure everything is still working

`npm run acceptance`

```
 PASS  tests/test_cases/get-restaurants.tests.js
  ● Console

<details>
<summary><b>Changing the config dynamically</b></summary><p>

Now let's see the config reload in action.

1. Load the index page in the browser, to make sure it's still returning 8 restaurants.

2. Go to `Systems Manager` console in AWS

3. Go to `Parameter Store`

4. Find the `get-restaurants` config, click `Edit`

5. Change the `defaultResults` value to 4, and `Save Changes`

![](/images/mod12-002.png)

6. Reload the index page, since we set the cache expiry to 5 minutes, you might have to reload a few times before you see the index page return 4 restaurants instead.

![](/images/mod12-003.png)

7. Change the `defaultResults` value back to 8, otherwise, our acceptance tests would start failing. And while you're here, click the `History` tab and see the revisions we have made to this parameter.

![](/images/mod12-004.png)

Of course, in practice, I don't expect anyone to be editing application config by hand, especially when the people that will be editing these configurations are not developers. Instead, I expect you to have some sort of internal tool where you can perform validation, etc. as well on the configuration.

Services like [Retool](https://retool.com) makes building these internal admin tools very easy. They have no direct integration with SSM so you'd have to build some integration layer yourself.

</p></details>

<details>
<summary><b>SSM Parameter Store and serverless.yml</b></summary><p>

At this point, I should also mention that the Serverless has built-in support for reading parameter values from the SSM Parameter Store. You can read more about it in their docs [here](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/variables/#reference-variables-using-the-ssm-parameter-store).

The difference is that, those parameters are read during deployment, so there's no mechanic for reloading them on the fly without redeployment, and it's also not a safe way to distribute application secrets, credentials and API keys, and so on.

We'll tackle application secrets in the next exercise, but for now, let's see how we can publicize the service URL for our demo app.

</p></details>

<details>
<summary><b>Increase SSM Parameter Store's throughput limit</b></summary><p>

By default, SSM Parameter Store doesn't charge you for usage. On the flip side, it restricts you to a measly **40 ops/second**. This is often not enough in a production environment, especially if functions need to load, and periodically refresh their configs from SSM Parameter Store.

Fortunately, you can significantly raise this throughput limit by, going to the `SSM Parameter Store` console, go to the `Settings` tab, and click `Set Limit`.

![](/images/mod12-009.png)

And accept that from now on, you'll incur cost for using SSM Parameter Store.

![](/images/mod12-010.png)

Don't worry, the cost of SSM Parameter Store is very reasonable and shouldn't be a huge burden on your AWS bill.

![](/images/mod12-011.png)

And you might noticed that you can also have "Advanced Parameters". This helps you alleviate the limit of 10,000 parameters per region, and 4KB per parameter.

If you have large configurations (up to 8KB) then you should consider using advanced parameters. However, since SSM now supports an intelligent tier, it's best to use that.

![](/images/mod12-012.png)

</p></details>

## Publicize service information to Parameter Store

**Goal:** Publicize the service's root URL and operation constraints to SSM Parameter Store for other services to consume

<details>
<summary><b>Output the service URL as an SSM parameter</b></summary><p>

1. Open `serverless.yml`.

2. In the `resources.Resources` section, add a `ServiceUrlParameter` resource after the `CognitoAuthorizer`.

```yml
ServiceUrlParameter:
  Type: AWS::SSM::Parameter
  Properties:
    Type: String
    Name: /${self:service}/${self:provider.stage}/serviceUrl
    Value:
      Fn::Join:
        - ""
        - - https://
          - !Ref ApiGatewayRestApi
          - .execute-api.${self:provider.region}.amazonaws.com/${self:provider.stage}
```

Oh, and while you're here, the crazy thing is that CloudFormation doesn't currently support `SecureString` parameters...

![](/images/mod12-005.png)

If this is something you need, then please let me konw and I can publish my CloudFormation custom resource for creating one.

3. Deploy the project.

`npx sls deploy`

And you should now see the parameter in SSM parameter store.

![](/images/mod12-006.png)

![](/images/mod12-007.png)

From here, other services that want to use your service can find out the service URL by referencing this SSM parameter.

</p></details>

<details>
<summary><b>Output the operation constraints as SSM parameters</b></summary><p>

In the `get-restaurants` and `search-restaurants` functions, we can potentially accept a query string parameter, say, `count`, to let the caller decide how many results we should return.

But when we do that, we're gonna want to make sure we have some validation in place so that `count` has to be within some reasonable range.

We can communicate operation constraints like this (i.e. `maxCount`) to other services by publishing them as SSM parameters. e.g.

`/{service-name}/{stage}/get-restaurants/constraints/maxCount`

`/{service-name}/{stage}/search-restaurants/constraints/maxCount`

Or maybe we can bundle everything into a single JSON file, and publish a single parameter.

`/{service-name}/{stage}/serviceQuotas`

(following AWS's naming)

We're not going to implement it here, but please feel free to take a crack at this yourself if you fancy exploring this idea further ;-)

And don't forget to share what you end up implementing with us in the Discord channel!
